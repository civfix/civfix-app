 * once - a paste, OR a browser autofilling the whole code into the first cell (its input carries
 * autoComplete="one-time-code"). applyOtpInput handles both with one rule: strip non-digits, then write
 * the digits across the cells starting at the edited index.

 *   across consecutive cells starting at `index`, capped at `length`.
 * - Empty / non-digit input: clears the edited cell (e.g. selecting a digit and deleting it).
