 * ROOMS: a consumer wanting "tell this user to refetch" should not depend on join/persist/history. A
 * connection is addressed by `userId` and stays "always joined" for the socket's whole lifetime, so
 * `subscribeUser` returns an async unsubscribe handle and the gateway holds exactly one disposer per
 * socket. A frame carries only a topic + optional scoping id, never entity data; the client refetches
 * authoritative state once it learns a domain is stale.
